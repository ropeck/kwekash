# kwekash

**kwekash** is a shell utility to easily run `weka` commands on the first available drive pod in your WEKA Kubernetes cluster.

It supports default actions, interactive mode, real-time monitoring via `watch`, and multiple kubeconfig contexts.

## üåê Kubeconfig Support

- You can specify a kubeconfig using `--kubeconfig <path>`
- If `--kubeconfig` is not passed, it will fall back to the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable
- If neither is set, `kwekash` will exit with an error

---

## üîç Requirements

- `kubectl` (or [`kubecolor`](https://github.com/hidetatz/kubecolor), preferred if installed)
- A running WEKA cluster with drive pods in the `weka-operator-system` namespace
- `watch` utility available in the pod (usually pre-installed in WEKA pods)
